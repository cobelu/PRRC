Wanna be a complete jerk to everyone using Chromecasts on an unsecured network? Of course you do!

Run this script to force-stream Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" to every single Chromecast-compatible device on your connected network at full volume. Be sure to use the Google Home app to verify that all devices were hit with the attack. Then, get ready to sing along.

This script works great for offices, colleges, and apartment complexes. Have fun!

Special thanks to the balloob's pychromecast package, which makes this possible.
